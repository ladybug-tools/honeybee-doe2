        acceptable, and is assumed to represent a flag temperature. When a temperature,
        the meaning of the value and its action varies by the component referencing the
        schedule. For example, in the SYSTEM:HEATING-SCHEDULE, the binary values 0 and
        1 disable and enable heating respectively. Any value other than 0 or 1 represents
        the outdoor drybulb temperature below which heating is enabled.

        For example, in the SYSTEM:NATURAL-VENT-SCH, a value of 0 forces the
        windows closed, and a value of 1 allows windows to be open if the outdoor
        temperature is suitable, and a flag value of –1 allows windows to be open if the

        between 0.0 and 1.0. An entry of –999 causes the schedule to be ignored for that
        hour. For example, in the SYSTEM:MIN-AIR-SCH, an entry of 0 or 1 will force the
        outdoor-air ratio to be 0% or 100% respectively. A value of –999 will cause the
        schedule to be ignored for the hour, and the outdoor-air ratio will be set by other
        calculations.

        criterion for the component to be active. For example, in the ELEC-METER:COGEN-TRACK-SCH, a flag value of 1
        means that cogeneration equipment should track the electric load, a value of 2
        means track the thermal load, 3 means track the lesser of the electric or thermal
