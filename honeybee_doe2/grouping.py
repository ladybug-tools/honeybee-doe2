    This means that not only will Rooms be on separate DOE-2 levels if their floor
    heights differ but also Rooms that share the same floor height but are
    disconnected from one another in plan will also be separate levels.
    For example, when the model is of two towers on a plinth, each tower will
    get its own separate level group.

    Args:
        rooms: A list of Honeybee Rooms to be grouped.
